I am a postdoctoral researcher in **Clinical bioinformatics & Machine learning in translational single-cell biology** group lead by [Prof. Dr. Manfred Claassen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/mitarbeiter/profil/2147). My work aims at machine learning based integration of high-dimensional cytometry and radiomics data to identify and monitor cancer-immunotherapy responses. 

I started my academic journey as a computer science engineer working primarily on the topic of spectral graph theory. Later on, I moved to the field of Systems Biology to explore how system properties emerge from collective interactions of the
components.

I hold a Dr.-Ing. degree in systems biology from the department of **Systems Theory and Automatic Control**, University of Stuttgart, Germany (2019), and having expertise in mechanistic modelling, nonlinear dynamics, uncertainty analysis in biochemical systems.
