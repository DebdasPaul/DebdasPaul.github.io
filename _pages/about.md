> आनो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वत: ऋग्वेद – 1.89.1 

I am a computer science engineer currently employed as 
a data scientist at the Fritz Lipmann Institute (Leibniz-Institut für Alternsforschung - Fritz-Lipmann- Institut e.V.), Jena, Germany. I am primarily engaged in building deep-learning models for aging research.

As a computer science engineer, I worked primarily on the application of spectral graph theory in complex systems. Thereafter, I took a digression from classical computer science and continued my journey in the field of Systems Biology, where I explored the mechanisms behind robust and reliable signal propagation in biological signaling networks using concepts/approaches from dynamical systems theory, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, stochastic analysis and rule-based modeling. 

Apart from computer science, I possess a great interest in quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and human history.

During my free time, I enjoy reading, photography, biking, and traveling.
