Welcome to my personal homepage!

I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician at the Hans-Knöll-Institut in Jena, Germany.

I started my academic career as a computer science engineer working primarily on the application of spectral graph theory in complex systems. Moved by the complexities of natural designs, I continued my journey in the field of Systems Biology, where I explored the mechanisms behind robust and reliable signal propagation in biological signaling networks. In my research, I like to combine data driven approaches with mechanistic modeling whenever possible.

Apart from systems biology, I possess a great interest in quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and human history.

During my free time, I enjoy reading, photography, hiking, and traveling.
