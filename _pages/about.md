I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry (MPI-BPC)](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/en), Göttingen in the group lead by [Dr. Juliane Liepe](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/15662258/cv_liepe).

At MPI, my work primarly involves building software pipelines and tools based on machine learning techniques for systematic analysis of large-scale mass-spectrometric data for quantification, prediction, and identification of peptides.

Before, I have completed my [doctorate](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/10523) (<i><b>magna cum laude</b></i>, certificate awaited) in systems biology from the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), Germany under [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Nicole Radde](https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/de/institut/team/Radde-00007/).

Besides, being a computational and systems biologist, I am also a computer science engineer by my previous background.

In my academic career so far, I have cultivated some varied research interests that includes **Bayesian inference**, **uncertainty quantification**, **machine learning**, **computational and systems biology**, **modeling and simulation of physical systems**, and **spectral graph theory**. In the coming years, I am looking forward to pursue an industrial career developing machine learning algorithms and combining them with AI  (for e.g., deep learning with symbolic reasoning) to make our society smarter and sustainable.

My [Erdös number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html) is <b>3</b>.
