I am a postdoctoral researcher in **Clinical bioinformatics & Machine learning in translational single-cell biology group** lead by [Prof. Dr. Manfred Claassen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/mitarbeiter/profil/2147).

My project broadly aims at discovery of biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy using machine and deep learning approaches. The project is funded by the **Swiss National Science Foundation** (SNSF) as a part of the [Sinergia](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/sinergia/Pages/default.aspx) consortium.


My [Erd√∂s number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html) is <b>3</b>.
