<b>Re-usability and Robustness of Python and Java programs</b> <br> 

<b>Paul, D.</b>, Vartak, S., 2012.

## Abstract
<p>“Re-usability” is one of the fundamental aspects of software development. Reusability of code enables us to add new functionality with minimum modifications. A module or class which is reusable reduces the implementation time and cost of maintenance. In this paper we investigate and compare the re-usability of Python and Java programs using graph theoretic approach. We define a metric to quantify reusability. Using the metric, we show that Python projects are more reusable than Java, which supports the design goal of Python. Apart from re-usability, we also address the question of “Robustness” for software programs. We cannot test robustness by removing nodes or edges from software dependency graph because removal of any nodes results into software crash. This makes the task more challenging. Therefore, we redefine robustness for software programs. We also define a metric to quantify robustness and compare Python and Java projects using the metric. We show that, Java programs are more robust than that of Python against random failure.
